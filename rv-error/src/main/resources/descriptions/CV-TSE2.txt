According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to initialize a value of one pointer type with a value of an incompatible pointer type unless one of the values is a void pointer, or the initializer is a null pointer constant. In practice, this can be a compiler error, however, some compilers relax this restriction and allow assignments between different pointer types without first performing a conversion. The correct solution is to avoid initializing pointers of one type with pointer values of another type, except according to the allowed exceptions.
