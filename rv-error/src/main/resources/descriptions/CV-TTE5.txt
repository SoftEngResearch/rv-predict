According to ISO C11, if one of the branches of a conditional expression is of struct or union type, the other must have the same type. It is a constraint violation if this rule is broken. In practice, this is a compiler error and will prevent the application from being built. The correct solution is to ensure that the types of the conditional expression are used correctly in order to construct a common type for the entire expression.
