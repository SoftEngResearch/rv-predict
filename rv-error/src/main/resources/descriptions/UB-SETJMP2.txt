According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to call longjmp in order to return control flow to a function that has stopped executing. In practice, this is likely to corrupt control flow in your application or directly result in abnormal program termination. To correct this issue, be sure the function corresponding to the environment saved by setjmp is still executing when calling longjmp.
