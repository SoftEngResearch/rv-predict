According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to compute the address of a bit field. In practice, this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being built. Since bit fields are not always aligned precisely on byte boundaries, they do not have addresses. The solution is to either remove the bit field attribute from the field, or, if it is necessary in order to confrom with an externally provided struct layout, to avoid taking the address of the bit field, for example by taking the address of the struct or union instead and performing a member access expression on the resulting pointer.
