According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to call va_start to initialize a va_list when the last fixed argument of the variadic function is declared with array or function type. In practice this can lead to incorrect behavior on some platforms. Because array and function types are converted to pointer types when used as parameters to a function, the correct solution is to explicitly modify the declared type of the parameter to correspond to its real type.
