According to ISO C11, arrays must have positive (i.e. nonzero, nonnegative) length. For fixed length arrays, this is checked at compile time, but for variable length arrays, if the value passed as the array size when the array is created is not positive, the behavior is undefined. In practice this can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The solution is to check the size of the variable length array and use a length of 1 if the value would otherwise be nonpositive.
