According to ISO C11, if memory cannot be allocated by realloc, it returns a null pointer. This error indicates that you have used more heap memory than was specified via the -fheap-size flag. While it may be the intended behavior, it is more likely that you have a memory leak or that your system has insufficient memory to execute this application. If this is the intended behavior, the error can be ignored with no ill effect in some cases; however, note that on some platforms running out of memory does not cause realloc to return null but instead causes it to return a pointer to a nonexistent memory page, which can trigger abnormal program termination when the memory is accessed.
