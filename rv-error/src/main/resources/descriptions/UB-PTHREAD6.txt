According to POSIX 2008, it is undefined behavior to attempt to unlock a PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT or PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL mutex which was not initialized as robust and which was not already locked by the current thread. In practice this could result in an error being returned, or it could result in corruption of the mutex, leading to incorrect synchronization and concurrency bugs. The solution is to either use a robust mutex, a PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK or PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE mutex, or to avoid calling pthread_mutex_unlock unless it is known that the current thread holds the mutex.
