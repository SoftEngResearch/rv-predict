According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior for a signal handler to return when the signal being handled corresponds to a computational exception (such as SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGSEGV, or other implementation-defined values). In practice, this can cause a crash, corrupted program state, or other unintended behavior. To resolve this issue, terminate the program in signal handlers for computational exceptions by calling either abort, quick_exit, or _Exit.
