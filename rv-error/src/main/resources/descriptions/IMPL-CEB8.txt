According to ISO C11, it is implementation-defined behavior to perform a bitwise right-shift on a signed integer whose value is negative. In practice, as implementation-defined behavior, the platform is required to document the behavior that occurs in this case. Generally, it will either pad with zeros, or sign-extend the value. What behavior results is determined by the platform. The solution is to either rely on the behavior of the platform, or, if the program should be strictly conforming, to only perform bitwise right shifts on positive values.
