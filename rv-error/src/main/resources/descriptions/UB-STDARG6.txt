According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to call va_arg when there are no variadic arguments remaining. In practice this can lead to accessing memory incorrectly and exposing memory to the user. The correct solution is for the function body to infer how many variadic arguments are passed to the function by some kind of function contract assumed to be followed at all call sites. In this case, you must either increase the number of arguments at the call site of the function, or reduce the number of times va_arg is called in the function body.
