According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to compute the offset of a bit field using offsetof. In practice, depending on platform, this could be a compiler error preventing the application from being built; or it could silently generate code that computes an incorrect offset, which could in turn lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Because the layout of bit fields is completely unspecified, it is not safe to assume that the bit of a bit field lie on a byte boundary and therefore computing their offset in bytes is not supported; code should not assume that a bit field will exist at a particular address.
