According to ISO C11, if one of the branches of a conditional is of pointer type and the other is an integer, the integer must be a null pointer constant. It is a constraint violation if this rule is broken. In practice, this can be a compiler error, however, some compilers will accept this code and coercthe integer argument to the type of the pointer. The correct solution is to ensure that the types of the conditional expression are used correctly in order to construct a common type for the entire expression.
