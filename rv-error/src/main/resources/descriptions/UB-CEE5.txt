According to ISO C11, performing an lvalue to rvalue conversion on an lvalue of incomplete type other than an incomplete array type is undefined. In practice this refers to either reading the value of a struct or union before its fields have been defined, or dereferencing a void pointer without first casting it to a pointer to a complete type. The solution in each case is to first make the lvalue refer to a complete type, and then use it in an expression.
