Calling sleep while holding a mutex can lead to the mutex being held for longer than is desirable, which in turn can slow down the application and lead to a lack of responsiveness in time-critical applications. If this is the intended behavior, this warning can be ignored with no ill effect, however, it may be desirable to avoid holding a mutex for such a significant period of time.
