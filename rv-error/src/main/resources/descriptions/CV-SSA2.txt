According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to declare a static assertion that does not compare unequal to 0. This represents a failed static assertion in the application, and provides a compiler error with a user-specified error message that prevents the application from being built. The correct solution is to either modify the static assertion so that it succeeds, or to only build the application on platforms where the static assertion is successful.
