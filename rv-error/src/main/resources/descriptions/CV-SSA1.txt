According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to declare a static assertion with an argument that is not a constant expression. In practice, this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being built. The correct solution is to either use a constant expression for the static assertion, or, if you wish to assert something that is not a constant expression, to use the runtime assertions provided by assert.h. Of course, runtime assertions are only checked when the application executes.
