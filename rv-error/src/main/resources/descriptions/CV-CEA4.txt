According to ISO C11, the subtraction operation must either have two operands of arithmetic type, two operands of pointers to compatible complete object types, or the left operand is a pointer to a complete object type and the right operand is an integer. It is a violation of a constraint to use a subtraction operation with any other pair of types. In practice, this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being compiled. The solution is to remove the subtraction expression or fix it so that it has the correct types.
