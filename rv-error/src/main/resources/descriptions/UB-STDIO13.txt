According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to use a length modifier (such as "l", "L", or "h") with a conversion specifier in a format string except in the cases explicitly covered by the standard. In practice, this error could lead to unexpected or non-portable behavior. It can be resolved by removing the length modifier or changing the format specifier and type of arguments.
