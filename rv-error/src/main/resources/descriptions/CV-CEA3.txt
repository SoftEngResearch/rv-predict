According to ISO C11, the addition operation must either have two operands of arithmetic type, or one operand of a pointer to a complete object  type and the other operand of an integer type. It is a violation of a constraint to use an addition operation with any other pair of types. In practice, this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being compiled. The solution is to remove the addition expression or fix it so that it has the correct types.
