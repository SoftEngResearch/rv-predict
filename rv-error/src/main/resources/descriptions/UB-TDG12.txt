According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to make a tentative declaration of an object using a declaration with internal linkage and incomplete type. In practice, the application has no way of knowing the size of such an object since it is never completed in this file and cannot be completed elsewhere due to being internal linkage. It may therefore choose the size incorrectly, leading to buffer overflow vulernabilities if a size was assumed by the programmer to be larger than was actually chosen. The solution is to either complete the type of the object or else give it external linkage.
