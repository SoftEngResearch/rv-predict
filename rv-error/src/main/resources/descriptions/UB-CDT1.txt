According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior for a struct to have, either directly or indirectly therough recursive subaggregates and unions, no named members. In practice, this code is generally accepted by most compilers; however, the standard provides no guarantees about the behavior of such types, such as their layout, initialization, and behavior. These details may differ from platform to platform depending on the ABI and the compiler. The portable solution is to always give structs at least one named member.
