According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior for the definition of main to be anything other than a function returning an int. In practice, this may interfere with correct program startup on some platforms, depending on precisely how program startup is implemented on that platform. This issue can be resolved by defining a main function using one of the forms allowed by the standard.
