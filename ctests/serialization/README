This directory contains tests of event-ring serialization.  Every test
should run to completion and produce the expected output.

Note: these tests will only pass on a little-endian host.

    the last element of the ring and ending with an element past the
    0th element

one_word/: write one word starting with the 0th element of the ring

wrap_one_word/: write one word starting with the last element of the ring,
    wrapping back to the 0th

full_ring/: write a full ring
