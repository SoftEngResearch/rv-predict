It is recommended to add RV-Predict/bin to your PATH.
	
Invoke `rv-predict` on a class as you would invoke the Java interpreter:

    rv-predict [options] class [args...]        #(to predict races in a class), or
    rv-predict [options] -jar jarfile [args...] #(to predict races in an executable jar)

where `[options]` include both RV-Predict and Java specific options.
 
Additional documentation can be found online on the 
[RV-Predict website](http://runtimeverification.com/predict/docs).
