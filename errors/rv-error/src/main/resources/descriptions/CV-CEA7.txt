According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to compute pointer addition of a pointer not to a complete object type. In practice this is usually a compiler error, however, some compilers allow an exception to this rule for the case when the pointer is a void pointer. The solution is to either complete the type, or to first cast the pointer to a complete object type prior to the pointer arithmetic expression.
