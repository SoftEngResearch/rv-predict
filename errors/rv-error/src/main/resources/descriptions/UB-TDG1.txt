According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior for a function to be declared with type qualifiers. There is no explicit syntax for doing so in the C language, however, it is still possible to do this with a typedef declaration. In practice the qualifiers are likely to be ignored, however, it is possible that this will generate a compiler error on some platforms that prevents the application from being built. The solution is to remove the type qualifiers; qualified function types do not exist in C and therefore do not have a meaning. Note that while type qualifiers can be applied to function declarations in C++, this does not create a qualified function type.
