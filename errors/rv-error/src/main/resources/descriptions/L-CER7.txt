This error is generated when a likely-invalid native pointer (as opposed to a symbolic pointer to objects in memory modeled by the semantics) is about to be dereferenced. Native pointers can be generated when the semantics is interoperating with native libraries or when an integer is cast to a pointer. Dereferencing an invalid pointer may cause a segmentation fault or other unintended behavior. If this is intended behavior, this error can be suppressed with no ill effect.
