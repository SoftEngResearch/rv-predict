According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint for a field of a struct or union to be of incomplete type (except for a flexible array member) or for a struct or union with a flexible array member to be a field of another struct or union. In practice this is a compiler error and prevents the application from being built. The solution is to complete the relevant type or to refactor the portion of the struct not containing the flexible array member into a separate struct type.
