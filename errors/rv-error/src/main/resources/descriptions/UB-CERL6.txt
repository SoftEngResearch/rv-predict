The ISO C11 standard provides no behavior for the value of performing ordered comparisons against the null pointer. As such this behavior is undefined. In practice, the behavior will depend on the code generated for the comparison, which is likely to depend on the address of the null pointer itself. The portable solution for comparing pointers against each other when one or both may be null is to compare each possible operand against null and handle these cases explicitly, prior to performing the ordered comparison.
