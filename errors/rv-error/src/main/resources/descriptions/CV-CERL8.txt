According to ISO C11, the operands of an equality comparison must either both have arithmetic type, both be pointers to compatible complete object types, one a pointer to a complete object type and the other a pointer to void, or one a pointer and the other a null pointer constant. It is a constraint violation if this rule is violated. In practice, this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being built. The solution is to either remove the equality expression or fix the types of the operands.
