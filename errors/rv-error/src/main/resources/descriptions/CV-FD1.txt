According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to redeclare an identifier with no linkage in the same scope and name space unless it is redeclared as a typedef defined to the same underlying type, or the identifier is a struct, union, or enum tag. In this case, multiple variables in the same function definition were declared with the same name. In practice this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being built. The correct solution is to either delete one of the parameters, or change its name to a name not used in the same scope.
