According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior for a function declared as inline with external linkage in a translation unit to not be defined in the same translation unit. In practice, this can lead to latent linker errors that do not show up until code is compiled with certain optimization levels. The solution is to always ensure that both a declaration and a definition occur for inline functions in the TU they are declared in.
