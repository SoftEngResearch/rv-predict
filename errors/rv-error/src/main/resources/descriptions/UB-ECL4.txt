According to ISO C11, restrict-qualified pointers cannot be used in such a manner that they violate certain restrictions pertaining to whether they refer to the same memory object as another unrelated object in scope. These restrictions are subtle and complex and you are encouraged to read up on them in the citations below. In practice, violating these restrictions can lead to incorrect and inconsistent program state. The solution is to either avoid using restrict qualified pointers in function definitions, or else to understand and obey the restrictions outlined by the C11 standard.
