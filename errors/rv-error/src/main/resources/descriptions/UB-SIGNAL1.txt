According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to call the signal function in a multithreaded program. The way in which signals interact with threads is dependent on the particular threads implementation. Raised signals might be delivered to handlers registered with signal in one or several threads or none at all. The solution to this issue will depend on the particular threads implementation. In the case of POSIX threads, the sigaction function should be used to register signal handlers instead of signal.
