According to POSIX 2008, when a thread is terminated while holding mutexes, the state of those mutexes becomes inconsistent, which can potentially make the mutex unusable. While this is allowed by the standard, it is also possible that you simply forgot to unlock the mutex at the appropriate time, which could potentially lead to deadlocks and other concurrency bugs. If this is the intended behavior, you can suppress this warning with no ill effect.
