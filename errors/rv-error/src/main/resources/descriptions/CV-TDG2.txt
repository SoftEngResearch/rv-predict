According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to use more than one storage class specifier in a declaration, with the exception that _Thread_local may be used with one of static or extern. In practice this is a compiler error that prevents your application from being built. The correct solution is to specify only one distinct storage duration and linkage on any given declaration.
