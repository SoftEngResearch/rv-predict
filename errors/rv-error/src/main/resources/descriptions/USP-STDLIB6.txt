According to ISO C11, it is unspecified whether a call to at_quick_exit which occurs after quick_exit has been called will succeed. This can occur because at_quick_exit is called directly or indirectly from a termination handler registered by a previous call to at_quick_exit. In practice, because this is unspecified behavior, such a call may succeed, or it may fail, and the compiler provides no guarantees about which behavior will occur. However, as unspecified behavior, the program is well defined, and it is guaranteed that one of these two outcomes will occur and the program will behave in accordance with whichever behavior results.
