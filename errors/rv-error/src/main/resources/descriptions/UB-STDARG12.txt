According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to call va_start to initialize a va_list when the last fixed argument of the variadic function has a type that is not compatible with the type that would result from applying the default argument promotions on the parameter. In practice this can lead to incorrect behavior on some platforms, which may depend on the assumption that this parameter is not modified by promotion. The correct solution is to either change the type of the parameter to the promoted type, or to change the signature of the function so that the last fixed argument is not modified by promotion.
