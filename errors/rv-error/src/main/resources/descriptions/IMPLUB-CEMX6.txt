If the second operand of an integer modulus operation is an unspecified or implementation-defined value, then, depending on the implementation, it could be 0. According to ISO C11, if the second operand of an integer modulus operation is 0, the behavior is undefined. In practice this generally leads to abnormal program termination, but it can also go into a trap handler or raise a signal instead, depending on the platform. The solution is to check for zero modulus explicitly and handle it separately if the second operand can be zero.
