According to ISO C11, calling va_start in a function without variadic arguments is undefined. On some platforms this is a compiler error; however, since it is undefined behavior, it is not strictly required by the C standard that a diagnostic be emitted for this case, and therefore it is possible that some C compilers will accept such programs and emit some kind of undesirable code. The solution is to either remove the call to va_start or to make the function a variadic function.
