According to ISO C11, two variable length array types are compatible regardless of their length, however, if they are used in a context which requires them to be compatible, and the actual length of the arrays is unequal, the behavior is undefined. In this case, this error occurred because the two clauses of a conditional expression were both variable length arrays of differing lengths. In practice this can lead to incorrect and inconsistent program state. The solution is to treat each variable length array type as a separate type unless their lengths are known to be equal.
