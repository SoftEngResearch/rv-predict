According to POSIX 2008, it is undefined behavior to call pthread_mutex_destroy on an object which is not a mutex initialized by pthread_mutex_init or by PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER. In practice this can corrupt internal state referring to the mutex in the pthread library, leading to incorrect synchronization and concurrency bugs. The solution is to ensure that pthread_mutex_destroy is only called on initialized mutexes and that copies of a mutex are not made.
