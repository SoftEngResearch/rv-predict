According to ISO C11, it is an error for a function to be called with more arguments than parameters in the function definition, unless the function definition declares variadic arguments with an ellipsis. This is generally a compile-time error, however, in some cases it can also lead to memory corruption at runtime if the function is declared first without specifying the number of arguments, and later defined with a different number of parameters than are used at the call site. The solution to avoid this problem is to always declare functions with the correct number of parameters, and to always declare functions which take no parameters with the (void) syntax.
