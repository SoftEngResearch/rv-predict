According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to call the aligned_alloc function with a size argument that is not an integral multiple of the alignment argument. In practice, this error could lead to unexpected or non-portable behavior. It can be resolved by changing the total size of the requested allocation or the requested alignment so that the size is a multiple of the alignment.
