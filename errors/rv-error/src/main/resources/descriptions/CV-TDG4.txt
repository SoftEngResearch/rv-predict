According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to use the auto or register storage class specifiers on a declaration at file scope. In practice this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being built. The solution is to remove the incorrect storage class specifier from the declaration and replace it with one that correctly specifies the linkage and storage duration of the declaration.
