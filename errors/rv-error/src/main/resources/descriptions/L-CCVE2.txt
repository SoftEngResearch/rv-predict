According to ISO C11, when a conversion to an unsigned integer generates a result that does not fit in the resulting type, the resulting value is converted modulo the power of two corresponding to the number of value bits in the integer type. This can lead to unintended behavior if this is not expected, causing incorrect arithmetic and potentially buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the value is used as an array offset. If the intended behavior is to wrap the resulting value into the range of the result type, this error can be suppressed with no ill effect.
