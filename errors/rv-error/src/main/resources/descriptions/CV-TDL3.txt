According to ISO C11, two declarations in the same scope that refer to the same object or function must have compatible types. It is a constraint violation if this rule is violated. In practice, this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being built. The correct solution is to fix all but one of the declarations to have the same type or a compatible type to the last declaration in that scope.
