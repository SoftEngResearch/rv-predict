According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to call va_start to initialize a va_list when the last fixed argument of the variadic function is declared with the register storage class. In practice this can lead to incorrect behavior on some platforms, which may be required to take the address of this parameter in order to initialize the va_list. Use of the register storage class is discouraged for this and other reasons, and because the compiler generally can effectively optimize register access without explicit hints. The correct behavior is to either remove the storage class specifier or change the signature of the function so that the last fixed argument does not have the register storage class.
