According to ISO C11, it is implementation-defined behavior to convert a non-null pointer to an integer. Using the converted value in an arithmetic expression is non-portable and may be undefined depending on the implementation. If converting pointers to integers is necessary, avoid using the result in arithmetic expressions because the standard makes no guarantees about the result of the conversion and it may be a trap representation.
