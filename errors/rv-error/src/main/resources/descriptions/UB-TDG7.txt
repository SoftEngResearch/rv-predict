According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to give a void parameter a type qualifier. In practice this is a compiler error and likely prevents your project from being built; however, since it is undefined behavior, it is not strictly required by the C standard that a diagnostic be emitted for this case, and therefore it is possible that some C compilers will accept such programs and emit some kind of undesirable code. The solution is to remove the qualifier from the parameter; since it denotes a function with no real parameters, a type qualifier is meaningless in this case.
