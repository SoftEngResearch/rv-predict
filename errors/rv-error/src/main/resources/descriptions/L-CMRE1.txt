According to ISO C11, a struct or union cannot be a trap representation, therefore, reading a struct or union whose fields were not initialized is not undefined behavior. However, it is likely unintended behavior, and the fields of the struct or union will still be indeterminate and therefore cannot be accessed individually. If this is the intended behavior, the warning can be suppressed with no ill effect, however, it is probably desirable to properly initialize the struct or union prior to reading its value.
