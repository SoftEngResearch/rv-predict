According to ISO C11, in a hosted environment, it is undefined behavior for the first argument of main function with arguments to be a type other than int. In practice this may interfere with the value of the argument passed to the main function or make program startup behave incorrectly on some platforms. The solution is to use int as the first argument of main.
