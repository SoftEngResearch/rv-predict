According to ISO C11, if a library function is called with an invalid value for that function, the behavior is undefined. In this case strcpy was called with a null pointer. In practice this will lead to abnormal program termination as memory is accessed at the null pointer address. The solution is to avoid passing null pointers to functions for which they are not explicitly allowed in the standard library, such as strcpy.According to ISO C11, if a library function is called with an invalid value for that function' the behavior is undefined.
