According to ISO C11 and POSIX 2008, it is undefined behavior to call thrd_join or pthread_join on a thread that has already been joined, on the calling thread itself, or with an invalid or uninitialized thread argument. In practice this can lead to incorrect synchronization or non-termination. To fix this issue, only call thrd_join and pthread_join on threads that have not previously been joined and with a valid thread argument (that is not the same as the calling thread).
