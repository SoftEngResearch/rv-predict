According to ISO C11, if two side effects occur on the same object in the same thread without sequencing between them (i.e., the standard defines no relationship with respect to which operation will be performed first in its memory model), the behavior is undefined. In practice this can lead to code being generated that reorders the side effects in a manner such that their behavior leads to incorrect and inconsistent program state. The solution is to introduce sequencing between the operations. This can be done with a comma operator for expressions, or by breaking a statement into multiple statements.
