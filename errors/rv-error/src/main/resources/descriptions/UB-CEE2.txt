According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to read the value of a variable whose value is indeterminate in many cases. While there are a few exceptions, such as reading the value through an lvalue of character type, or reading the value of an object whose type does not contain trap representations, in general this is considered a very strong antipattern as the value of such bits is completely unspecified and may contain confidential information left over from previous objects at that address whose lifetime has ended. It is recommended that you avoid reading uninitialized memory entirely, in order to avoid safety and security errors arising from the unspecified value. However, in many cases this behavior is undefined and may corrupt the value of memory or registers at which the resulting value is stored. If you don't care about what value is read from some unspecified bytes, but simply want to read some value, it is recommended that the memory first be zeroed to avoid this error.
