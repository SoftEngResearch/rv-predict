According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to perform an assignment with a left operand that is not a modifiable lvalue. In this case, const lvalues are not modifiable and therefore cannot be written to. In practice, this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being built. The correct solution is to avoid trying to write to objects declared as const. Note that casting away the constness does not fix this issue, as it is still an undefined behavior to write to an object that was declared const.
