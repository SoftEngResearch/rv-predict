According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint for the _Alignas specifiers on a declaration to specify an alignment less strict than the alignment requirement of the type of the declaration. In practice this is a compiler error and prevents the application from being built. The correct solution is to specify an alignment via _Alignas that is greater than or equal to the alignment of the underlying type.
