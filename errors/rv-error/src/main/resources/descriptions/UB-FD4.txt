According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior for the definition of the main function to be declared without a prototype (i.e., as an old-style function declaration). In practice, this may interfere with correct program startup on some platforms, depending on precisely how program startup is implemented on that platform. Generally speaking, old-style function declarations are deprecated and should be avoided wherever possible; the solution is to use a function prototype when defining the main function.
