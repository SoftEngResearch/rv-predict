According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to modify objects returned by certain library functions (such as getenv, setlocale, localeconv, and strerror). In practice, the compiler assumes these objects do not change value, and thus violating this rule can lead to incorrect and inconsistent program state. The solution is to never try to modify an object returned by one of these library functions.
