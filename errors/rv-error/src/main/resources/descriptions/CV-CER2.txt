According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to compute the address of a variable declared with the register storage class. In practice this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being built. Generally, the compiler does a good job inferring which fields to place in registers, and the register keyword is not required. As such, the preferred solution is to remove the register storage class. However, if it is required, the solution is to avoid taking the address of the variable, since variables stored in registers do not have an address.
