According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to declare an array with length zero or a negative length. In practice this can be a compiler error, however, some compilers will accept an array with zero length as an exception to this rule. The correct solution is to either declare the array with length 1, or else, if the array is the last field of a struct, to declare the array as a flexible array member.
