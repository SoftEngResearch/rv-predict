According to ISO C11, writing to an object containing a string literal is undefined behavior. In practice this will generally lead to abnormal program termination, because string literals are stored in read-only memory. However, on some platforms this behavior may be allowed, but lead to incorrect and inconsistent program state. The solution is to copy the string literal into a writeable object and modify the copy.
