According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to pass a format string argument to one of the formatted input or output functions (e.g., printf, fprintf, scanf, etc.) without also providing the correct number of additional arguments as required by the format string. In practice, this error could cause crashes and potentially corrupt the call stack frame. It can be resolved by either changing the format string to require fewer arguments or by removing extra arguments.
