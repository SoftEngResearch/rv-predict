According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to initialize a va_list using va_start or va_copy which has already been initialized with one of these functions without an intervening call to va_end. In practice, this can lead to incorrect initialization of the va_list which can in turn lead to accessing memory incorrectly and exposing memory to the user. The correct solution is to call an initialization function exactly once to initialize a va_list with either an indeterminate value or a value resulting from a call to va_end.
