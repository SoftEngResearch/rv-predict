According to ISO C11, it is implementation-defined behavior to declare a bit field with a type other than signed int, unsigned int, or _Bool. In practice, such a program could be rejected by the compiler on some platforms. As implementation-defined behavior, the platform is required to document what types are allowed. The solution is to either rely on the behavior of the platform, or, if the program should be strictly conforming, to only use one of the three standard types for bit fields.
