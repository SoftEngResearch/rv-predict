According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to compare a value of integer type to a value of pointer type using an ordered comparison operator. In practice, this can be a compiler error, however, some compilers allow this case by converting the integer to a pointer prior to the comparison. The solution is to either use an equality comparison operator, if you wish to compare the pointer against the null pointer, or to convert the integer address to a compatible pointer type prior to performing the comparison.
