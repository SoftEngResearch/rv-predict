The ISO C11 standard provides no behavior for the value of calling a null pointer. As such this behavior is undefined. In practice, this behavior will almost certainly result in abnormal program termination as the program attempts to execute instructions at the null pointer address as if there were a function definition there. The solution is to ensure that function pointers are never null prior to a function call operation. If a function pointer that is about to be called could be null, check whether it is null and if it is null, handle the error explicitly.
