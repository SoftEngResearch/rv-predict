According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to read from an object of volatile qualified type through a non-volatile qualified lvalue. In practice this interrupts the code generation which provides volatile variables with certain guarantees regarding their values in the concurrent memory model, and can lead to incorrect and inconsistent program state in which the value read from the variable does not match its real value. The solution is to avoid casting away volatile qualifiers on objects in order to access them.
