According to ISO C11, in a hosted environment, it is undefined behavior for the main function to have more than two or exactly one argument, with the exception of certain implementation-defined variations. In practice this may interfere with the value of the arguments passed to the main function or make program startup behave incorrectly on some platforms. The solution is to use one of the approved variations of the main function.
