According to ISO C11, in a hosted environment, it is undefined behavior for the second argument of main function with arguments to be a type other than char **. In practice this may interfere with the value of the argument passed to the main function or make program startup behave incorrectly on some platforms. The solution is to use char ** or char *[] as the second argument of main. Note that a pointer to a type-qualified-type is not sufficient, such as const char **.
