According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to declare an object with no linkage and an incomplete type. In practice this is usually a compiler error, since the lack of linkage means it cannot be redeclared later as a complete type, and therefore the size of the object is unknown; however, since it is undefined behavior, it is not strictly required by the C standard that a diagnostic be emitted for this case, and therefore it is possible that some C compilers will accept such programs and emit some kind of undesirable code. The solution is to either give the object linkage and complete its type elsewhere in the program, or to give the object a complete type.
