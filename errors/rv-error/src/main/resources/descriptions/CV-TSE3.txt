According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to initialize a static object with a non-constant initializer. In practice this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being built. The correct solution is to initialize the variable at program startup. Note that C++ lifts this restriction and automatically performs non-constant initialization of static variables at program startup.
