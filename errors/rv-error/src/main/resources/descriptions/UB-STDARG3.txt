According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior to call va_arg on a va_list which has not been initialized by either va_start or va_copy. In practice this can lead to accessing memory incorrectly and exposing memory to the user. The correct solution is to call an initialization function to initialize a va_list prior to a call to va_arg.
