According to ISO C11, in a hosted environment, it is undefined behavior for a main function to return a type other than int. In practice, this may interfere with the exit status of the application or make program termination behave incorrectly on some platforms. The solution is to use int as the return type of main. Note that type-qualified types such as const int are not sufficient for this requirement.
