According to ISO C11, it is implementation-define behavior to access an object with thread-local or automatic storage duration from a thread other than the thread with which it is associated. In practice, this may lead to incorrect and inconsistent program state or even abnormal program termination, depending on whether such an access is allowed by the platform. As implementation-defined behavior, the platform is required to document the behavior of such accesses. The solution is to either rely on the behavior of the platform, or, if the program should be strictly conforming, to use only static and allocated storage objects to communicate data between threads.
