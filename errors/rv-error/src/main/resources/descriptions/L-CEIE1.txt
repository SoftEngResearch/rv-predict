Your application has allocated memory on the heap that is not freed prior to program termination. This could be a memory leak if the memory in question is no longer live at program termination. It could also be the case that the memory is used for the entire lifetime of the application and is simply not cleaned up explicitly when it is no longer being used. If this is the intended behavior, this error can be suppressed with no ill effect, however, deallocating memory when it is no longer being used will decrease the memory footprint of the application.
