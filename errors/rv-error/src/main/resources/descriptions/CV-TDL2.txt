According to ISO C11, it violates a constraint to declare an object at block scope that has an initializer with the storage class specifier extern. In practice, this is a compiler error that prevents the application from being built. The correct solution is to either declare the variable as a global variable locally using the static keyword, or declare the variable and define it at file scope.
