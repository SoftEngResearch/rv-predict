According to ISO C11, if a function parameter of array type is qualified with the static keyword, and the function is called passing an argument which is not an array with at least as many elements as the declared array length of the parameter, the behavior is undefined. In this case, the value passed was not of array type. In practice, this can lead to incorrect code being generated, which leads to incorrect and inconsistent program state when the function is called. The solution is to either not qualify the array with the static keyword, or to ensure that all calls to the function pass as its argument a pointer to the first element of an array with the correct number of elements.
