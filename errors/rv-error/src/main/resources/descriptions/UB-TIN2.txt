According to ISO C11, if a variable with external linkage is defined more than once in different translation units, it is undefined behavior. Generally this is a linker error and will prevent the program from being compiled; however, since it is undefined behavior, it is not strictly required by the C standard that a diagnostic be emitted for this case, and therefore it is possible that some C compilers will accept such programs and emit some kind of undesirable code, such as assigning both objects the same address in the binary. The solution is to provide at most one definition of all variables that are used in the program.
