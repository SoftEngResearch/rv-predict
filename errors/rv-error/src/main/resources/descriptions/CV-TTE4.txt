According to ISO C11, if one of the branches of a conditional expression is of void type, the other must be of void type. It is a constraint violation if this rule is broken. In practice, this can be a compiler error, however, some compilers will accept this code and coerce the second argument to void type. The correct solution is to ensure that the types of the conditional expression are used correctly in order to construct a common type for the entire expression.
