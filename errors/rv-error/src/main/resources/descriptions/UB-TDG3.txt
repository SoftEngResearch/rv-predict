According to ISO C11, it is undefined behavior for a function at block scope to be given a storage class specifier other than extern. In practice this is generally a compiler error, preventing your application from being built; however, since it is undefined behavior, it is not strictly required by the C standard that a diagnostic be emitted for this case, and therefore it is possible that some C compilers will accept such programs and emit some kind of undesirable code. The solution is to remove the storage class specifier; it does not have meaning in this case.
