# Using RV-Predict

The RV-Predict programs ordinarily are installed at
$HOME/RV-Predict-C/bin/.  Make sure that directory is part of the
executable search path, $PATH.  The important RV-Predict programs are
`rvpc` and `rvpx`.

`rvpc`: a wrapper for `clang` that compiles and links programs with
    RV-Predict instrumentation.  When a program built with `rvpc` runs,
    it will ordinarily leave a trace file called `rvpredict.trace`
    in the current working directory.

`rvpx`: a wrapper for programs that were built with RV-Predict
    instrumentation.  If you ordinarily run your program like
    `<command> <arguments>`, then run `rvpx <command> <arguments>` to
    see data-race reports. `rvpx` redirects the trace file for <command>
    from `./rvpredict.trace` to a temporary directory.  Then it analyzes
    the trace for data races.  After reporting any data races on the
    standard error output, `rvpx` deletes the temporary directory.

`rvpsymbolize`: a filter that takes the name of an ELF executable file,
    `program` as an argument.  `rvpsymbolize` copies its standard
    input to its standard output with data and instruction addresses
    converted to symbols: using the DWARF debug information in `program`,
    `rvpsymbolize` replaces each hexadecimal instruction pointer enclosed
    in curly braces, {0x...}, with the corresponding function name,
    file, line number, and optional column number.  It also replaces
    each hexadecimal data address enclosed in square brackets, [0x...],
    with the corresponding symbol name.  For structures, `rvpsymbolize`
    makes a best effort to tell a data member name, and for arrays,
    `rvpsymbolize` makes a best effort to tell an array index.

`rvpdump`: a program that will read an RV-Predict compact trace
    file, `rvpredict.trace`, and print it to standard output in a
    human-readable format (default action) or, if the `-t legacy`
    option is provided, translate from the compact trace format to the
    legacy trace format.  Either provide the name of the trace file on
    the command line, `rvpdump rvpredict.trace`, or feed the trace into
    standard input, `rvpdump < rvpredict.trace`.

    Use the option `-t symbol-friendly` to produce human-readable output
    that is suitable for symbolization using `rvpsymbolize`.

    A user does not ordinarily need to run `rvpdump`.  The `-t legacy`
    option is deprecated; it may be removed from a future version of
    `rvpdump`.

In /home/vagrant/lib/ are the RV-Predict Java classes, the runtime
libraries for the latest edition of RV-Predict/C, and the product
license key.  Those files must be present for RV-Predict/C to work,
but the user does not ordinarily need to do anything with them.
