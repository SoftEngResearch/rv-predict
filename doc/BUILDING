Make sure that you have Clang 3.9 in your PATH.

Here are some programs that must be available:

	awk
	clang+llvm-3.9.0 with development components (.h, .a/.so files)
	gmake
	grep
	JDK 1.8
	lex
	libarchive
	m4
	mk-configure
	opam
	pandoc
	sed
	yacc

OPAM packages required by the unified error reporting in errors/:

	Probably NOT needed: zarith mlgmp 

	Definitely needed: csv uri ocamlbuild-atdgen ocp-ocamlres

	Maybe needed: uuidm camomile atdgen atdj ctypes ctypes-foreign

	Install with `opam install -y <packages here>`.

Configuring a build environment:

	sudo apt install maven openjdk-8-jdk-headless
	sudo apt install opam m4
	opam init
	opam update
	opam switch 4.03.0
	eval `opam config env`
	opam install ocp-ocamlres ocamlbuild-atdgen csv uri atdgen atdj
