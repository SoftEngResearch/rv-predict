Make sure that you have Clang and LLVM 3.8.1 in your PATH.  E.g.,
if you have downloaded binaries for Ubuntu 14.04:

export PATH=${HOME}/clang+llvm-3.8.1-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-14.04/bin:${PATH}

Here are some programs that must be available:

	awk
	clang+llvm-3.8.1 with development components (.h, .a/.so files)
	grep
	JDK 1.8
	lex
	libarchive
	m4
	mk-configure
	opam
	pandoc
	sed
	yacc

OPAM packages required by the unified error reporting in errors/:

	Probably NOT needed: zarith mlgmp 

	Definitely needed: csv uri ocamlbuild-atdgen ocp-ocamlres

	Maybe needed: uuidm camomile atdgen atdj ctypes ctypes-foreign

	Install with `opam install -y <packages here>`.
