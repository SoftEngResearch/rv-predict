Runtime Verification Prediction
-------------------------------
RVPredict is a sound dynamic predictive race detection tool that detects data races
through constraint solving. A salient feature of RVPredict is that all reported races
are verified to be real, i.e., RVPredict never reports false alarms.

RVPredict runs through these phases:

Instrumentation    - The program is instrumented at runtime using a java agent.
Logging            - The instrumented program generates execution logs.
Prediction         - Prediction occurs. For race detection this consists of an
                     un-ordered read-write or write-write conflict to a shared 
                     variable.
                     
-- Prepare
RV Prediction uses Z3 or Yices to verify races. 
To install Z3, follow the instruction at 
          http://z3.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#README
To install Yices, follow the instruction at
         http://yices.csl.sri.com/download-yices2.shtml
Remember to add the z3 or yices (or both) binaries to your PATH

-- Running 
#Invoke rv-predict on a class as you would invoke the Java interpreter
Usage: bin/rv-predict [rv_options] [--java] [java_options] class [args...]
                     (to predict races in a class)
   or  bin/rv-predict [rv_options] [--java] [java_options] -jar jarfile [args...]
                     (to predict races in an executable jar file)

where [rv_options] are rv-predic specific options 
(run rv-predict --help -v for more information), 
  --java can be used as a separator for the java command line
the remainding arguments are what one would pass to the java executable to 
execute the class/jar
The --java option is only required in the less frequent case when some of 
the java or program options used have the same name as some of the 
rv-predict options (including --java).

Moreover, in the unlikely case when the program takes as options -cp or -jar
and is is run as a class (i.e., not using -jar) then the java -cp option must 
be used explicitely for disambiguation.

-- Examples
bin/rv-predict -cp tests/bin demo.Example     - Predict races

Using --java to specify that the first -v argument should be sent to rv-predict,
while the second one to the java command
bin/rv-predict --verbose --java -verbose -cp tests/bin demo.Example  

Using rv-predict with a jar
bin/rv-predict -jar benchmarks/ftpserver/ftpserver.jar
