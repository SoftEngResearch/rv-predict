RV-Predict is a sound dynamic predictive race detection tool that detects data races
through constraint solving. A salient feature of RV-Predict is that all reported 
races are verified to be real, i.e., RV-Predict never reports false alarms.

RV-Predict runs through these phases:

Instrumentation    - The program is instrumented at runtime using a java agent.
Logging            - The instrumented program generates execution logs.
Prediction         - For race detection this consists of an un-ordered read-write
                     or write-write conflict to a shared variable.
                     
-- Prepare
Add the bin directory under the RV-Predict installation directory to your PATH

-- Running
#Invoke rv-predict on a class as you would invoke the Java interpreter
 rv-predict [options] class [args...]        (to predict races in a class), or
 rv-predict [options] -jar jarfile [args...] (to predict races in an executable jar)
where [options] include both RV-Predict and java specific options.
Run rv-predict --help for details.
