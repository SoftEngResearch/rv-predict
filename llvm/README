# Source layout

	cmade/: wrapper for components built by CMake, including our
	    instrumentation pass
	ngrt/: next-generation runtime that is simpler and faster
	    than the one derived from tsan.
	pass/: standalone instrumentation pass derived from
	    Thread Sanitizer (tsan)
	runtime/: standalone runtime derived from tsan.  This is
	    not built any longer, but we keep it around as a reference.
	test/: tests for instrumentation, just barely started

# Building

To build both the runtime (`librvprt.a`) and the instrumentation pass
(`rvpinstrument.so`):

	mkcmake depend
	mkcmake

To install in your home directory---files librvprt.a and rvpinstrument.so
will appear in `$HOME/lib/`:

	mkcmake PREFIX=$HOME install

# Using

See the manual and source code for `rvpc`.
