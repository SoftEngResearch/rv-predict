# Source layout

	cmade/: wrapper for components built by CMake, including our
	    instrumentation pass
        librvread/: library of utility functions for reading Predict
            trace streams, shared by rvpdump/ and Umang Mathur's HB
            implementation
	ngrt/: next-generation runtime that is simpler and faster
	    than the one derived from tsan.
	pass/: standalone instrumentation pass derived from
	    Thread Sanitizer (tsan)
        personality/: an assortment of interrupt personalities
            that you can link with your program using `rvpc
            --intr-personality=...`.  Interrupt personalities implement
            the state machine that determines whether or not a program
            under test can enter an interrupt service routine (ISR) and
            forces the program to "spontaneously" enter eligible ISRs.
	runtime/: standalone runtime derived from tsan.  This is
	    not built any longer, but we keep it around as a reference.
	rvpdump/: utility program for displaying RV-Predict/C trace
	    files
        sigsim/: signal simulations that you can link with your program
            using `rvpc --sigsim=...`.  A signal simulation makes sure
            that all signals are raised at least once in every interval
            where they are established and not masked.  This is useful
            for testing programs that are expected to spontaneously
            receive signals with Predict.  For example, the programs in
            the Toyota ITC benchmark are designed to be run with static
            analysis, so the signal simulation is useful there.

# Building

To build and install both the runtime (`librvprt.a`) and the
instrumentation pass (`rvpinstrument.so`), follow the instructions in
`doc/DEVELOPER.md`.

# Using

See the manual and source code for `rvpc`.
